# WignerDistribution_4D
 Generates a 4D wigner distribution for a 2D input signal. The wigner transform enables the viewing of the primal and dual (for e.g. time and frequency) domains simultaneously.
 
 Requires the Matlab Version >= R2022a due to the use of tensorprod function linked (here)[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/tensorprod.html]
